Backlog
----

List of things I need to do:

	- create a top-level init file (path is hard-coded) in which a path to the connection init file is specified -> this is for password security reasons
	- in the top level init file add a TUI quiet option (i.e. do not display some stuff) the quite should be a TUI class variable that is taken into accountby the display method
	- write set up documentation (user and database creation)
	- figure out Psycopg2 pool for connections (create a class for handling connection pÅ‘ools and quires)
	- write documentation on config file -> see new ideas on config file setup
	- write testing module for the init config files
