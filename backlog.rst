Backlog

List of things I need to do:

	- fill docstrings with minimal documantation
	- write documentation on config file
	- write testing module for the init config files
	- check if defaults are actually working
	- implement init config file within the SpacerTUI class
	- in app.py have a run_app() function and a separete main() function for testing purposes (also this keeps the option to have command line arguments in the main function)
