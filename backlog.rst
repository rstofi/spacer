Backlog
----

List of things I need to do:

	- write set up documentation (user and database creation)
	- move documentation from rst to md format (this is procrastination I know)
	- remove all the unecessary code for the connection setup
	- re-think codebase for SQLite database backend
	- check schema code compatiblity with SQLite
	- re-design README to match with my working examples
	- move this file to Documentation
