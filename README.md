# SPACER - SimPle job AppliCation trackER

`spacer` is a lightweight command-line tool to track your job applications, helping you stay organized and analyze your statistics.

## Features

- Track job applications, including company details, application status, and interview information.
- Analyze statistics such as the number of applications submitted, applications per company, and more.
- Simple and intuitive command-line interface.

## Installation & Requirements

Currently, the latest release of SPACER can be installed from source. Follow these steps:

```
git clone https://github.com/rstofi/spacer.git
cd spacer
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

`spacer` requires a [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) installation.

## Usage and Contribution

`spacer` is primarily developed for personal use as a small practice project while looking for jobs. The tool provides flexibility as data needs to be provided manually, allowing it to handle various job opportunities.

Although SPACER is designed for personal use, the code is open-source and open-access for anyone to use or contribute to. Contributions in any form are more than welcome, and I aim to fix any bugs as quickly as possible.

Detailed tutorials and documentation will be added once the core code is finalized.

The documentation is mostly embedded in the code itself, with an additional a brief description of the code and usage included under the [Documentation](https://github.com/rstofi/spacer/blob/main/Documentation/README.md) folder. The Documentation is designed to be readable in GitHub, and there is no plan to set up a more serious online documentation yet.
