Backlog

List of things I need to do:

	- write set up documentation (user and database creation)
	- move documentation from rst to md format (this is procrastination I know)
	- re-design README to match with my working examples
	- add a *lock* mode to the uinput in the TUI, so I can add a company named q and have similar things working -> i.e. fix thsi bug with all default key binding checks
	- add option to switch schema enforcement in connection ON/OFF
	- The get_uinput_with_message() with def_val and enable_yn params returns None ionstead of the def_val
	- The constraints in my SQL schema are working based on id rather than value -> change this
	- enable multi line input for certain values even from ctrl+v solutions
