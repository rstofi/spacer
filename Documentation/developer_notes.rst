Backlog
----

List of things I need to do:

	- write set up documentation (user and database creation)
	- move documentation from rst to md format (this is procrastination I know)
	- re-design README to match with my working examples
	- add a *lock* mode to the uinput in the TUI, so I can add a company named q and have similar things working
