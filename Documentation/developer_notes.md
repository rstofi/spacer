# Backlog

List of things I need to do:
	- collect issues, and fill out what I need to add/work on
	- define requirements for v1.0 (+ add some core design principles)
	- containerization
	- write tests


**Questions gathered:** (these I need to check in code, how they work)
	-[] how does db initialization works, and can I add an external db as a parameter
